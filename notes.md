## Color Helpers Added (2026-08-31)
- **PR #115**: Added `color` module to `motif_core` with 6 color construction helpers:
  - `rgb(r, g, b)`: opaque color from [0.0, 1.0] floats
  - `rgba(r, g, b, a)`: color with alpha from [0.0, 1.0] floats
  - `gray(v)`: opaque gray from single lightness value
  - `rgb_u8(r, g, b)`: opaque color from [0, 255] u8 values
  - `rgba_u8(r, g, b, a)`: color with alpha from [0, 255] u8 values
  - `with_alpha(color, alpha)`: clone a color with new alpha
- All re-exported from crate root via `pub use color::*`
- 11 unit tests; infra build failure (Linux missing fontconfig - parley dep)

## DrawContext Line Helpers Added (2026-08-30)
- **PR #114**: Added axis-aligned line convenience methods to DrawContext:
  - `paint_h_line(x, y, length, color, thickness)`: horizontal separator/divider
  - `paint_v_line(x, y, length, color, thickness)`: vertical separator/divider
- Both delegate to `paint_quad`; offset, clip, and scale factor apply automatically
- 6 new tests: dimensions at 1× scale, offset accumulation, 2× HiDPI scaling (each method)

## Quad Builder API Added (2026-08-29)
- **PR #113**: Added Quad builder methods and DrawContext convenience paint methods:
  - `Quad::with_corner_radius(f32)`: uniform corner radius
  - `Quad::with_corner_radii(Corners<f32>)`: per-corner radii
  - `Quad::with_border(color, f32)`: uniform border
  - `Quad::with_border_widths(color, Edges<f32>)`: per-edge border
  - `DrawContext::paint_rounded_quad(bounds, fill, radius)`: common rounded rect case
  - `DrawContext::paint_outlined_quad(bounds, fill, border_color, width)`: bordered rect
- 8 new tests (5 in scene.rs, 3 in context.rs)

## Div Layout API Added (2026-08-29)
- **PR #112**: Added 18 new layout methods to `Div`:
  - Asymmetric padding: `padding_x`, `padding_y`, `padding_top/right/bottom/left`
  - Margins: `margin`, `margin_x`, `margin_y`, `margin_top/right/bottom/left`
  - Size constraints: `min_width`, `min_height`, `max_width`, `max_height`
- Fills gap between `padding(f32)` (uniform only) and real-world CSS-like layout needs

## Perf Bug Found and Fixed (2026-08-28)
- **layout_bounds() O(depth²) recursion**: Fixed in PR #111. Iterative O(depth) loop.

## Bug Found and Fixed (2026-08-26)
- **DrawContext::with_clip nested clip bug**: Fixed in PR #110. Inner clips now intersect with outer clips. Three new tests.

## Dependency Audit
- Last audit: 2026-08-02 (PR #92 updated with 162 package updates)
- Next audit: 2026-09-07

## TODO Coverage
- All p1/p2 TODO items: open PRs exist
- P3 "Visual regression test harness": PR #109 (done 2026-08-23)
- P3 "Move hardcoded colors to theme": blocked on PR #44 (Theme trait) merging first
- Inline TODOs: max_width in layout.rs → covered by PR #39; clipboard in playground.rs/todomvc.rs → covered by PR #53

## Bench CI Fix
- Status: BLOCKED — modifying .github/workflows/ requires workflow permission scope
- Maintainer must apply patch from issue #107 or run 31635670794 artifacts
- Then close issues #101, #102, #104, #105, #106, #107

## Future Improvement Ideas
- `Edges::new(top, right, bottom, left)` explicit constructor (currently only `all()` and `symmetric()`)
- `Corners::new(tl, tr, br, bl)` explicit constructor (currently only `all()` and `top_bottom()`)
- These would pair well with PR #113 (Quad builder API)

## Structural Notes
- Project: immediate-mode Rust UI framework, Metal GPU backend, macOS only currently
- Codebase: motif, motif_core, motif_debug, motif_debug_cli, motif_test crates
- Uses Taffy for layout, swash for text rasterization, parley for text layout
- Active streams: text-input-rewrite, todomvc, layout, theming, cross-platform, devtools, animation, accessibility
- All major feature areas have open Repo Assist PRs
- Linux build blocked by missing fontconfig (parley dep) — all PRs use infrastructure note
